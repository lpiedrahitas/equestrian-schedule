# Equestrian Schedule Optimization
## Project Overview:
This project showcases a comprehensive approach to optimizing equestrian event schedules, initially developed using Excel Solver and later expanded with Python and Gurobi Optimizer. The aim is to create an optimal strategy for a top rider and their horses over a series of competitive events, maximizing prize money while adhering to critical constraints for horse and rider welfare and competition rules.

## Development Journey:
1. Initial Phase with Excel Solver: The project began with an Excel-based model, providing an intuitive and accessible solution for the optimization problem. The initial report and presentations were created based on this model, offering insights into foundational strategies and outcomes.
2. Further Development in Python: To address more complex scenarios and incorporate advanced constraints, the project was extended using a Python-based model with Gurobi Optimizer, enhancing the solution's flexibility and robustness.

## Key Features:
1. Optimization of Prize Winnings: Strategic selection of events for maximizing total prize earnings.
2. Detailed Constraint Handling: Adheres to constraints like limited participation weeks, non-consecutive week participation, and limits on horse entries per week and event.
3. Customizable Framework: The model can be tailored to various event schedules, prize money distributions, and horse rosters.

## Technology Stack:
1. Python & Gurobi Optimizer: Employed for the advanced stage of optimization.
2. Excel Solver: Used for initial modeling and straightforward solutions.

## Repository Contents:
1. Excel Solver Model and Documentation: The foundational model and accompanying report and presentations.
2. Python Notebook: Represents the evolved and more sophisticated optimization approach, further developing the initial model.

## Usage:
This model serves as an essential tool for equestrian team managers and strategists, enabling them to plan effective season schedules that optimize performance and success while ensuring the welfare of the horses.
